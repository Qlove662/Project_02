Gif/Website Search Engine


Website builds on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am creating a GIFs search engine using an API. This project will require a search bar to
search for Gifs.


Technology:

.HTML
.CSS
.JS


Ideas:

Interactive navbar that has a Gif image.

Menu with options and images that are clickable.

Search results with an enter button and ability to click the search button.


User Stories:

As a user, I want to to copy or paste Gifs that can be shared.

As a user, I want to search Gifs by entering a keyword or phrase.

As a user, I want Gif options when I enter keywords or phrases.

As a user, I want to see and view all of the Gif options in rows or columns.

As a user, I want the images to easily be viewed and organized.
